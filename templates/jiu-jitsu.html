                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is more than a martial art—it's a moving meditation that teaches problem-solving 
                    under pressure, technical precision, and the importance of fundamentals. What draws me to BJJ is how 
                    it challenges both body and mind in equal measure.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    On the mat, there's no hiding from mistakes. Every roll is immediate feedback on your technique, 
                    positioning, and decision-making. This direct, honest feedback loop is something I value deeply, 
                    and it's taught me to embrace discomfort as a path to growth.

                            Small details make the difference between a technique working and failing. The same attention 
                            to detail that makes a submission effective is what makes code reliable and maintainable.

                        <p class="text-gray-600">
                            When someone is trying to submit you, you have to think clearly and act decisively. This 
                            ability to problem-solve under pressure translates directly to debugging production issues 
                            and handling system failures.

                            Advanced techniques are built on solid fundamentals. Without a strong base of basic positions, 
                            escapes, and submissions, nothing else works. This mirrors how solid engineering fundamentals 
                            enable more complex systems.

                            BJJ is humbling. You'll get tapped by people smaller, weaker, or less experienced than you. 
                            This constant reminder that there's always more to learn keeps me grounded and open to feedback.

                        The lessons from the mat apply directly to my work:

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Position before submission:</strong> In BJJ, you establish position before attempting 
                            a submission. In software, you build solid foundations before adding complex features.</li>
                        <li><strong>Efficiency over strength:</strong> Technique beats strength in BJJ. In software, 
                            elegant solutions beat brute force approaches.</li>
                        <li><strong>Defense first:</strong> Good defense prevents bad situations from getting worse. 
                            In software, defensive programming and error handling prevent small issues from becoming 
                            major problems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Chain reactions:</strong> In BJJ, one technique sets up the next. In software, 
                            well-designed systems have components that work together seamlessly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pressure testing:</strong> Rolling with a resisting opponent tests your technique 
                            in real conditions. Testing software under realistic load reveals weaknesses that don't 
                            show up in ideal conditions.</li>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">
                            Regular training, even if shorter sessions, beats sporadic intense training. The same principle 
                            applies to code quality—consistent good practices beat occasional perfectionism.

                            I spend significant time drilling basics: guard retention, escapes, and fundamental submissions. 
                            These are the building blocks that make everything else possible.

                            Every training partner has something to teach, whether they're more or less experienced. 
                            This openness to learning from anyone is valuable in software engineering too.

                        Beyond the physical techniques, BJJ is a mental discipline. Staying calm when you're in a bad 
                        position, thinking several moves ahead, and maintaining focus throughout a roll—these mental 
                        skills are just as important as the physical techniques.

                        laboratory for developing mental resilience.
