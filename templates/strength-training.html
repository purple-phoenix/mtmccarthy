                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Strength training is more than building muscle—it's a systematic approach to physical development 
                    that mirrors how I approach professional growth. The principles of progressive overload, consistency, 
                    and attention to form are directly applicable to building durable software and developing technical skills.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Every session is an opportunity to push slightly beyond previous limits, to refine technique, and to 
                    build on the foundation of previous work. The parallels between building physical strength and building 
                    software systems are striking: both require patience, systematic effort, and a long-term perspective.

                            Gradually increasing the stress placed on the body to drive adaptation. This principle of 
                            incremental improvement applies directly to learning new technologies and taking on 
                            increasingly complex projects.

                            Regular training, even when motivation is low, compounds over time. The same consistency 
                            in coding practice, code reviews, and learning builds expertise that can't be rushed.

                            decisions that prioritize sustainable progress over quick wins.

                        The parallels between strength training and software engineering are profound:

                        <li><strong>Progressive overload:</strong> Just as you gradually increase weight or volume in 
                            training, you take on increasingly complex problems in software. Each project builds on 
                            previous experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compound movements:</strong> Exercises like squats and deadlifts work multiple 
                            muscle groups simultaneously. Similarly, well-designed software components serve multiple 
                            purposes and integrate seamlessly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recovery and rest:</strong> Muscles grow during recovery, not during training. 
                            Taking breaks from coding, getting sleep, and maintaining work-life balance are essential 
                            for sustained performance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Form and fundamentals:</strong> Bad form leads to injury; bad code leads to 
                            technical debt. Both require constant attention to fundamentals and best practices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plateaus and breakthroughs:</strong> Progress isn't linear in either domain. 
                            Plateaus are normal, and breakthroughs often come after periods of apparent stagnation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Systematic approach:</strong> Effective training follows a program. Effective 
                            software development follows processes, patterns, and methodologies.</li>

                        and to trust the process even when progress seems slow—these are all valuable skills that transfer
